1:The brutal and tyrannous King K of the nearby land of Dookia has uncovered a legendary ring that gives its possessor the power to cast devastating magic.  King K plans to march into battle with the ring in one week's time to subjugate the land of Carolinia under Dookian rule forever.  You are Rameses, an elite Carolinian warrior.  The King of Carolinia has sent you on a quest to King K's castle, the dreaded castle Dookenstein, in hopes of recovering the ring and saving your country.

2:INVSELECT:1^*In order to pass through Dookia without arousing suspicion, you selected a disguise to enter the country with.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian merchant, you can talk your way through situations by pretending to be a harmless trader.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian mercenary, you can pretend to be looking for work while being constantly ready for combat.  If you take the stealthy dark garb of an assassin, you would arouse more suspicion but easily blend into dark areas. <br>Which clothes did you pick?

3:INVSELECT:4^*When you were leaving Carolinia, you were given a pouch of gold coins, provisions, and access to the royal armory to obtain items you needed for your quest.  In order to travel lightly for the long journey to the Dookian castle, you decided to take just four items from the store room. <br> Which items did you take?

4:You manage to arrive at Castle Dookenstein without incident.  The castle is a towering fortress of stone that looms over the countryside, surrounded by a deep moat.  An ancient forest is to the right of the castle.  There is a path that leads to the castle drawbridge and the main gate, which is closed.  Across the drawbridge, there are two guards in full Dookian armor standing by the gate.  On the top of the castle, there are several more guards facing the front of the castle and holding crossbows.  You come up with several ideas to enter the castle, but all of them are risky. <br>  You could try to talk your way past the guards and enter the front gate. <br> You could avoid the guards and try to swim across the moat.  <br> You could hide in the forest and try to shoot the gate guards with a crossbow.  <br> You could go to the back side of the castle and try to grapple up to the roof with a grappling hook.

11:You hide in the woods and carefully aim at one of the gate guards with your crossbow.  Your aim is true and the guard falls to the ground.  The other guard sees this and shouts an alarm.  The castle gate opens and six armed soldiers on horseback emerge and gallop towards the forest, where you are hiding.  The horses are fast and will approach you very soon.

13:RESTART:^*You dive into a thick patch of bushes that manage to conceal your person.  You hear the soldiers dismount and begin to search for you.  You lie completely still as several of the soldiers begin to hack at the nearby undergrowth with their swords.  After a few minutes, one of the swords cuts through to your hiding place.  Before you can react, the soldier runs you through. <br> Your life ends here.

14:You immediately start sprinting through the trees away from the castle.  The thick undergrowth hinders your progress, as you have to force your way through the vegetation.  You look over your shoulder and see the soldiers dismount their horses to give chase.  Three of them load crossbows and point them at your fleeing form.  Despite the heavy vegetation, the soldiers have a clear shot at you.
14:Dive to the ground^*15^*Keep running and hope you are not hit^*16
15:RESTART:^*As you dive to the ground, you can hear crossbow bolts whiz over your head.  Unfortunately, you dive into a thick patch of briars, which lodge into your clothes and skin.  The thorns tear at you as you struggle to extricate yourself, and by the time you struggle free, one of the soldiers has managed to catch up to you.  He cuts you down with his sword. <br> Your life ends here.

16:LOSEHEALTH:5^*Two of the crossbow bolts lodge harmlessly into trees, but one of them buries itself into your right shoulder (You lose 5 health).  Ignoring the pain, you continue to run haphazardly through the woods.  After several minutes of frenzied running, you are forced the stop from pain and exhaustion.  The soldiers are nowhere to be seen, but you realize that you are lost.  Except for a stream flowing on the left, there are no visible landmarks in sight.

You are starting to feel faint from blood loss (You have lost 5 more health).  If you pull the bolt out, you can wash the wound in the stream and bandage yourself with supplies from your first aid kit.  However, pulling the bolt out may cause you to pass out from the resulting bleeding.

21:RESTART:^*You decide to leave the bolt in your shoulder and start trying to find your way out of the woods.  You start to follow a path of broken twigs from where you ran, but you feel so weak you can hardly concentrate.  You soon reach the point where your wounded body can take no more and you collapse to the ground. <br>Your life ends here.

23:You manage to follow a path of broken twigs and torn foliage from where you ran, although it takes you several hours.  Your body is tired from the beating it took and you have to rest several times.  When you finally reach the castle again, it is nightfall.  You see that there are many guards patrolling the castle walls.  With the increased security and your wounded state, the only way you can think of to enter the castle is to use the cover of night to sneak to the moat and swim across it.

100:You work your way around to the back of the castle looking for a good place to attach your grappling hook.  Fortunately, you don't see any guards patrolling the back wall.  The main crenellations are too high up to attach your grappling hook to, but you see two towers with windows that you could grapple to on opposite ends of the castle.  The northern tower is a bit higher up than the eastern tower, but you can see the faint flicker of torchlight coming from the eastern tower.

After a few more failed tries you realize that your grappling hook is not quite long enough to reach this ledge.  You see a nearby tree that you climb with a large, sturdy looking branch that you could stand on to give you the height difference that you need.

102:You walk over to the eastern tower and you swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window.  The window is very high up and it is an extremely difficult throw.  After several failed tries, your arm is sore from the effort.  You are about to give up when you have a stroke of luck and the grapple catches on the ledge of the window.  The hold seems firm, but you cringe at the idea of scaling a large length of wall with your sore arms.

You see a small, slime covered waste disposal hole that you could try to squeeze through, but you do not relish the thought.

You struggle across the moat and are barely able to grab on to the grate, where you spend a few minutes choking and retching.  Swallowing the disgusting moat water has caused you to lose 5 health.

As you try to struggle through headfirst, fetid water drips off of your clothing and you are coated with a layer of slime and rotten food.  On the other side, you see a large kitchen.  After several long minutes of struggling, you manage to get your bruised body through.  The painful struggle has cost you another 5 health.  You see an exit on the other side of the room and a basin of water nearby that looks like it is used to wash dishes.

One of them glances over at you and gives a shout when he sees your wet, filth-covered clothes and body.  All the guards draw weapons and come after you.

You panic and try to struggle, but the guard holds you in a firm grip.  The other guard remains outside and bolts the door behind you.
