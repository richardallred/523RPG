1:The brutal and tyrannous King K of the nearby land of Dookia has uncovered a legendary ring that gives its possessor the power to cast devastating magic.  King K plans to march into battle with the ring in one week's time to subjugate the land of Carolinia under Dookian rule forever.  You are Rameses, an elite Carolinian warrior.  The King of Carolinia has sent you on a quest to King K's castle, the dreaded castle Dookenstein, in hopes of recovering the ring and saving your country.

2:INVSELECT:1^*In order to pass through Dookia without arousing suspicion, you selected a disguise to enter the country with.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian merchant, you can talk your way through situations by pretending to be a harmless trader.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian mercenary, you can pretend to be looking for work while being constantly ready for combat.  If you take the stealthy dark garb of an assassin, you would arouse more suspicion but easily blend into dark areas. <br>Which clothes did you pick?

4:You manage to arrive at Castle Dookenstein without incident.  The castle is a towering fortress of stone that looms over the countryside, surrounded by a deep moat.  An ancient forest is to the right of the castle.  There is a path that leads to the castle drawbridge and the main gate, which is closed.  Across the drawbridge, there are two guards in full Dookian armor standing by the gate.  On the top of the castle, there are several more guards facing the front of the castle and holding crossbows.  You come up with several ideas to enter the castle, but all of them are risky. <br>  You could try to talk your way past the guards and enter the front gate. <br> You could avoid the guards and try to swim across the moat.  <br> You could hide in the forest and try to shoot the gate guards with a crossbow.  <br> You could go to the back side of the castle and try to grapple up to the roof with a grappling hook.

11:You hide in the woods and carefully aim at one of the gate guards with your crossbow.  Your aim is true and the guard falls to the ground.  The other guard sees this and shouts an alarm.  The castle gate opens and six armed soldiers on horseback emerge and gallop towards the forest, where you are hiding.  The horses are fast and will approach you very soon.

13:RESTART:^*You dive into a thick patch of bushes that manage to conceal your person.  You hear the soldiers dismount and begin to search for you.  You lie completely still as several of the soldiers begin to hack at the nearby undergrowth with their swords.  After a few minutes, one of the swords cuts through to your hiding place.  Before you can react, the soldier runs you through. <br> Your life ends here.

14:You immediately start sprinting through the trees away from the castle.  The thick undergrowth hinders your progress, as you have to force your way through the vegetation.  You look over your shoulder and see the soldiers dismount their horses to give chase.  Three of them load crossbows and point them at your fleeing form.  Despite the heavy vegetation, the soldiers have a clear shot at you.
14:Dive to the ground^*15^*Keep running and hope you are not hit^*16
15:RESTART:^*As you dive to the ground, you can hear crossbow bolts whiz over your head.  Unfortunately, you dive into a thick patch of briars, which lodge into your clothes and skin.  The thorns tear at you as you struggle to extricate yourself, and by the time you struggle free, one of the soldiers has managed to catch up to you.  He cuts you down with his sword. <br> Your life ends here.

16:LOSEHEALTH:5^*Two of the crossbow bolts lodge harmlessly into trees, but one of them buries itself into your right shoulder (You lose 5 health).  Ignoring the pain, you continue to run haphazardly through the woods.  After several minutes of frenzied running, you are forced the stop from pain and exhaustion.  The soldiers are nowhere to be seen, but you realize that you are lost.  Except for a stream flowing on the left, there are no visible landmarks in sight.

You are starting to feel faint from blood loss (You have lost 5 more health).  If you pull the bolt out, you can wash the wound in the stream and bandage yourself with supplies from your first aid kit.

The main crenellations are too high up to attach your grappling hook to, but you see two towers with windows that you could grapple to on opposite ends of the castle.  The northern tower is a bit higher up than the eastern tower, but you can see the faint flicker of torchlight coming from the eastern tower.

After a few more failed tries you realize that your grappling hook is not quite long enough to reach this ledge.  You see a nearby tree that you climb with a large, sturdy looking branch that you could stand on to give you the height difference that you need.

102:You walk over to the eastern tower and you swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window.  The window is very high up and it is an extremely difficult throw.  After several failed tries, your arm is sore from the effort.  You are about to give up when you have a stroke of luck and the grapple catches on the ledge of the window.  The hold seems firm, but you cringe at the idea of scaling a large length of wall with your sore arms.

There is a single door that leads out of the room, and you think that you can hear the faint sound of voices outside.

The cross feels warm and seems to pulse in your hand with raw power.  As the demon sees it, the smile on its face turns into a menacing snarl.  "That cross is mine," growls the demon, "You have no right to hold it like that."  The flames circling around you suddenly grow higher and more intense.  The demon holds out a large, gnarled hand.  "Throw me the cross," says the demon, "Or I will roast you slowly before I take it myself."  The cross seems to pulse in your hand with protest and you can feel it building up energy.

Its face once again breaks into an infernal smile.  "As your reward, I will roast you quickly instead of slowly," says the demon as it sweeps both of its hands upwards.  A gigantic jet of flame bursts through the pile of bones under you and incinerates you on the spot.  <br>Your life ends here.

154:You pretend to start to throw the cross towards the demon's outstretched hand, but you quickly change your aim and toss it into the circle of blue flames around you.  The demon roars with fury as it watches the cross melt into liquid.  The demon swipes a clawed hand at you and you duck just in time to avoid being beheaded.  As the liquid metal seeps into the ground, the wasteland begins to shake as if from an earthquake.  You lose your balance and start tumbling down the pile of bones.  Fortunately, the blues flames circling you rescind back into the ground before you are burnt.  As the rumbling intensifies, you see the blue demon being sucked back into the rip in the ground.  It howls and claws at you before it disappears underground.  The rumbling of the wasteland intensifies, and the ground splits into thousands of cracks below you.  A powerful jet of steam bursts from the cracks in the ground, and the force of it causes you to fly upwards towards a large stone ceiling above the wasteland.  You tumble upwards through a fissure in the ceiling that was directly above the large bone pile, and you land in a heap next to the fissure.

155:RESTART:^*You feel the cross surging with power, and you almost unconsciously channel it and launch a deadly bolt of magic towards the demon.  The bolt hits the demon directly in the chest, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.  "You seek to use my own power against me?" roars the demon.  Using the cross has drained your energy, and you are unable to avoid the demon's furious retaliation.  It reaches through the flames and rips your head off with its clawed hand.

156:"You mortals are always greedy until the end," growls the demon.  It waves its hand and a goblet made from a human skull appears in your hand.  It is filled with a thick, black liquid.

As you hit the pile, your heavy platemail armor protects you from the several of the sharp bones cutting into you.  You feel a blast of heat as a circle of searing blue flames rises around you.  As you struggle to get up from the pile of bones that you are lying on, the ground in front of you rips open.  From the tear in the ground, a massive demon rises up before you.

Behind you, you can see a large fissure in the catacombs floor that would be impossible to jump over or otherwise cross.  On either side of you, you can see rows of shelves containing stone coffins.  The corridor in front of you is littered with bones that seem to be scattered haphazardly across the ground.  You have nowhere else to go, so you walk forwards, picking your way among the bones.  Eventually the catacombs splits off and you see a short hallway that leads to a set of upwards stairs.  You climb the stairs and exit through a door at the top.  You emerge in a large cathedral.

You slowly and painfully pull yourself up the bricks, which cut into your hands as you try to climb them.  You manage to make it up a good distance before your aching hands lose their grip, causing you to plummet into the moat below.  You hit the moat with such force that it knocks you out, and you end up floating facedown in it. <br>Your life ends here.

You crawl past walls that have cracked with age and brush away several cobwebs.  Suddenly, you hear the pattering of many tiny feet.  You see a swarm of rats approaching you.

You continue to crawl forwards, forcing the rats back with your torch each time.  This works for a while, until several of the hungry rats decide to try to leap past the torch to get to you.  You react quickly, swatting them down with the torch and setting them ablaze.  The rats run around in panic, setting others in the swarm on fire.  You quickly back away from the blazing mass of rats, but the smoke filling up the tunnel is too much for your lungs and you pass out from the lack of oxygen.

After you think you have passed most of the rats, you slam your arm against the wall, stunning the rats that were attached to you.

You sleep until you are jolted awake by the blasting of a horn.  The other soldiers in the tent grumble as they get up, and you get up with them and leave the tent.  It is early in the morning, and several soldiers are sitting down as servants serve them bowls of gruel.

487:You leave your tent and walk around the courtyard.  In the moonlight, you can see several soldiers standing around talking with each other.  Some of the soldiers are loudly carousing as they drink ale in small groups.  You see a cluster of plain white tents around you, and several more in the distance.

488:INVREMOVE:Grappling hook^*You attach the grappling hook to one of the crenellations and use the rope to rappel down the wall.  Since the grappling hook is firmly attached to the wall, there is no way to retrieve it and you leave it behind.
488:Continue^*500
489:LOSEHEALTH:15^*Your Carolinian warrior training has taught you how to fall long distances without harm by dissipating the force of the fall through your entire body.  You steel yourself and leap from the wall.  You hit the ground and roll, but the fall is severe and your body is jolted with pain from the impact.  You lose 15 health from the fall, but you check yourself and find that you did not break any bones.
489:Continue^*500
490:You walk along the wall until you can see a guard in the distance.  He is crouched near one of the crenellations and holding a crossbow.  He is looking out towards the outer bailey at the moment, but if he turned towards you, he would see you.

491:You light your torch with your tinderbox and continue down the stairs.  Soon, you reach the bottom of the staircase and you can see a large underground storeroom in front of you.  It is clear that this storeroom has not been used in a while, since there are sacks strewn across the floor and cobwebs stretch across the corners of the room.  On the far wall of the room, you can see a gaping hole surrounded by many cracks in the stone.

492:Feel your way along the walls of the room^*493^*Blindly walk through the center of the room^*496^*Climb back up the stairs^*415
493:You feel your way along one of the walls in the room, until you feel a gap in the wall.  In this gap, there is a deep pit, above which the air is warm and humid.  When you smell the air near the pit, your nose is assaulted by a terrible, rotten stench.

494:Examine the gaping hole^*495^*Leave and climb back up the stairs^*415
495:You see that the gaping hole in the wall leads downwards into a dark pit.  Even with the light from your torch, you cannot see the bottom of the pit.  You get a whiff of air from the pit and you cringe as you receive a terrible, rotten scent.

496:Search through the sacks^*542^*Keep walking forwards^*543
497:INVREMOVE:Rope^*Using the length of rope you bought at the merchant stalls, you tie one of the ends around one of the crenellations and rappel down the wall with the rest of the rope.  Since the rope is tied to the wall, there is no way to retrieve it and you leave it behind.
497:Continue^*500
498:You hook your grappling hook to one of the broken sections of the wall, making sure that it stays firm.  Since you need both hands to climb down the rope, you extinguish your torch and put it back into your pack.  As you climb down, you feel a rush of hot air and the smell becomes almost unbearable.  After a while, you reach the end of the grappling rope.
498:Let go of the rope and drop to the ground^*750^*Climb back up the rope^*1369
499:RESTART:^*You tie your rope to one of the broken sections of the wall, making sure that it stays firm.  Since you need both hands to climb down the rope, you extinguish your torch and put it back into your pack.  As you are climbing, your weight pulling on the rope breaks the piece of wall that it is attached to, sending you plummeting down the pit.  You do not survive the fall.

502:You duck into one of the white tents, startling awake three men who were sleeping on straw beds inside.  The inside of the tent is very sparse, and next to the three beds are sets of Dookian soldier armor.  The three soldiers that you startled awake grab swords and move to attack you.
502:Fight the soldiers^*605^*Run back out of the tent^*603
503:You quickly duck into one of the ornate tents.  The interior of the tent is fairly luxurious.  You see a bed with a man sleeping on it.  Next to the bed, you see a sword and a set of gilded armor that belongs to Dookian army officers.  You also see a locked chest, a writing desk, an empty food plate, and several jugs of ale.  As you rustle the tent flaps, you startle awake the sleeping man, who grabs the sword next to him and jumps up to attack you.
503:Fight him^*602^*Run back out of the tent^*603

508:Return to the courtyard^*507
509:VARSET:barracksVisited,1^*The barracks is a squat building that is connected to part of the castle wall.  The barracks is very busy right now and guards are coming in and out of the entrance.  Behind the barracks, many soldiers are sparring with each other and with training dummies in a fenced off field.  Inside several windows of the barracks, you see an array of beds.  Inside the main entrance of the barracks, you see a large chamber where a huge man with scars crossing his face is writing something on a piece of parchment.  You walk up to the barracks entrance and the man turns and looks at you.  "I don't recognize you," he growls, "Are you one of the new recruits?"
509:Say that you are a new recruit^*441^*Ask him what he is recruiting for^*504^*Say that you were just visiting^*505
510:You tell the scar-faced man that you would like to join the invading army.  "You will refer to me as Colonel Graywald," he says, "I am your commanding officer."  He leads you inside the barracks to an armory full of weapons and armor for the soldiers.  "Get in uniform and report to the training field immediately," he orders, before walking out of the room.

520:The well in the center of the courtyard is a large with a stone base.  There is a tightly wound rope around the top that holds a large bucket for drawing water.  You peer down into the well, but you can see nothing but blackness.

522:You use the handle on the side of the well to unwind the rope that is attached to the bucket.  It takes quite a while until the rope is completely unwound and the bucket hits water.  Seeing the unwound rope gives you the crazy idea of trying to climb down it.  The rope looks quite thick and would probably support your weight, but it is rotted and frayed in places.  If the rope broke, you might be trapped in the well forever.

You scramble onto the pile of bones and barely avoid getting scorched by several flames jetting up underneath you.  You feel a blast of heat as a circle of searing blue flames rises around you, forcing you to climb to the top of the bone pile.  Suddenly, the ground in front of you rips open.  From the tear in the ground, a massive demon rises up before you.  Its blistered, scaly skin is an unnatural shade of blue and two large blue horns jut from its head.  You can see a diabolical grin on its face and a thick mustache on its pointed chin.
